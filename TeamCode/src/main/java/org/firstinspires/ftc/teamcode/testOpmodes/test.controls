i think the speed is 0.8.

i think that the driveMotors are fl, fr, br, and bl; bl is reversed.

the leftStickY, the leftStickX, and the rightStickX control the driveMotors with the omni calculation.

the slowSpeed is the speed with a scale of 0.5;

the gamepad2LeftStickY, the gamepad2LeftStickX, and the gamepad2RightStickX control the driveMotors with a higher priority, an omni calculation, and a scale of the slowSpeed.

the aButton sets the drum to 1.
dpadDown sets the drum to -1 with a lower priority.
the leftTrigger does the flywheel
i promise that when the aButton is pressed, the shooterArm is 0.8. otherwise, it is 0.
