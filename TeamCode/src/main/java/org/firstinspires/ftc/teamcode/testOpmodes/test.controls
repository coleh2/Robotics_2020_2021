i think the speed is 0.8
i think that the driveMotors are the flMotor, the frMotor, the brMotor, and the blMotor

the leftStickY, the leftStickX, and the rightStickX control the driveMotors with the omni calculation

the slowSpeed is the speed with a scale of 0.5

the gamepad2LeftStickY, the gamepad2LeftStickX, and the gamepad2RightStickX control the driveMotors with the higher priority, an omni calculation, and a scale of the slowSpeed

the aButton sets the drum to 1
dpadDown sets the drum to -1 with a lower priority
the leftTrigger does the flywheel
i promise that when the aButton is pressed, the shooterArm is 0.8. otherwise, it is 0.


i promise that fl is the flMotor
i promise that fr is the frMotor
i promise that br is the brMotor
i promise that bl is the blMotor with a scale of -1
